# nmcli-easy
Easy and interactive way to configure static IP using nmcli

nmcli is being adopted as the primary way to configure static IP in linux.
I am having troubles remembering all the commands so I made this to be an interactive and easy way to do so without the hassle of remembering everything because time is valuable.
